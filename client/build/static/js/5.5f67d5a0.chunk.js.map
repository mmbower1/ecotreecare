Water displaces soil gases, including oxygen, and oxygen-deprived \n              roots lead to vulnerable trees and premature decline. This availability of \n              gaseous oxygen to tree roots is a fundamental physiological need, and tree \n              deprived of it due to over-irrigation and/or poor drainage suffers over time.
